@super
	rofi --show drun

doesn't work but xcape can be used for that apparently. Can't find ksuperkey(the thing arch craft uses for this) so i'm just gonna use xcape.

this dude has a series on bspwm

finally understood how nodes and selection works in bspwm

[REFERENCE#]DESCRIPTOR(.MODIFIER)* this line explains stuff
[] means optional
() means required
! is 'not' basically

so ```any.!focused``` will return any window which *isn't* focused
note: this only works in /bin/sh and not bash

direction in bspwm is using the compass because you can flip stuff around so up down left right becomes complicated.

```bspc query -M --names``` shows the names of all the monitors

need to configure polybar

and configure neovim

```polybar-msg cmd restart``` is to restart polybar

you can't see the polybar border by default.
margin-top = 0 was not working because border-size = 4. the border is invisible for some reason


need to compile bspwm with backlight(aka brightness) support
customize rofi 

both are next

customize neovim with pywal i guess
ok got it sorta working but lualine is broken with it


screenshot binds
rofi 
configure dunst

using flameshot (rip minimalism)
